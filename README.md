# homeworks-and-learning

This repository contains my programming homework assignments and practice code as I learn and develop my programming skills.

## Purpose

- Store programming assignments from various courses
- Practice coding exercises and challenges
- Document my learning journey
- Experiment with different programming concepts

## Structure

Each folder typically represents a different course, topic, or practice area. Code is organized to help track progress and maintain reference materials for future use.

Feel free to browse through the code, but please note that this is primarily a personal learning repository. While the code here may be helpful as reference, it's meant to document my own learning process.

## Languages & Topics

The repository may contain work in various programming languages and cover different computer science topics as I continue learning.
